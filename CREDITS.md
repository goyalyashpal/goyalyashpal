## Credits for resources:

Thanks to all the great gratis resources:


### Icons:

* [Github Topics] also contains the logo images.
  Repo: [github/explore][explore-topics-repo], path: `topics/<TOPIC>/<..TOPIC.EXT..>`

* [Shields.io API] to show [logos][shields-logos] from [Simple Icons][simpleicons] as a [badge][shields-static-badge]

  Format:

  ```link
  https://img.shields.io/badge/
    [[<label>]-][<message>]-<color>?
      style=for-the-badge
      logo=<ICON_SLUG>
      logoColor=<COLOR>
      [label=<LABEL>]
  ```

* [VectorLogoZone][vectorlogo]
* [Devicon] for providing logos as fonts, which makes it verrry easy to use & fine tune the placement/alignment. \
  Though, github readmes don't support the html's linking mechanism in markdown.

All the logo/icons etc are property of their respective owners.


### Github Stats:

* [GitHub Stats Trophies][stat-trophy] by ryo-ma \
